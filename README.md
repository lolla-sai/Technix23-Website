## Tech Stack

**Client:** NextJS13-React, TailwindCSS, GSAP, StyledComponents, json for data

**Registeration Handling:** lu.ma event pages

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Lodrina Solid, a custom Google Font.

## Lessons Learned

While building this website, I acted as a dev lead, overseeing contributions by everyone, and integrating it into the incremental builds. In this process I learned team management, and working in teams.

I also learnt newer concepts of NextJS 13, including the latest <Image/> component, font rendering improvements, etc.

Together with my team, I managed to be a builder of a website that was viewed by students across colleges of Goa.

This is something I will always remember and be proud of!
